# PyBer_Analysis
Module 5: PyBer with Matplotlib

## Overview of the Analysis 
THe purpose of this analysis was to create a chart that would easily visualize the total fare by city type.  This was done by grouping the cities by type and calculating the averages per ride and driver.

## Summary
- Urban cities consistently have the highest average total fare and rural has the lowest.  This makes sense since there are more drivers in urban areas and more demand in urban areas 

- increasing drivers in the suburban areas may increase the amount of revenue the company gets

- Recommend looking into possible reasons why there are peaks around late February and early April.
